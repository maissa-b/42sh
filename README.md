# 42sh
## The project 42sh is a project from 42'school, in the Unix branch

This is the last project in UNIX branch (before internship project), it's further
to 21sh (https://github.com/maissa-b/21sh), and add some features.

It's a group project, and we decide by time issue to supress job control from our
project, and only added globbing and substitution to the 21sh.
